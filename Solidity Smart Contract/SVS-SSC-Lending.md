## Description
The decentralized lending protocol allows users to lend or borrow cryptocurrency without interacting with a centralized intermediary. Some lending protocols also support yield farming and derivative trading.

## Threat Modeling
- Oracle integration
    - **Price manipulation** (Does the price feeder have enough liquidity? )
    - **Price result queried from oracle** (Does the precision of the price, the price ratio (i.e., A/B or B/A) align with the calculation?)
    - **Prices updated**(Are the price up-to-date? Over how much time the price can be considered to be invalidï¼Ÿ)
- Reentrancy attack vectors
    - Are **ERC677/ERC777** tokens used in the project?
    - Are **ERC721** tokens used as collateral/position tracker in the project?
    - Are there any **native token transfers**?
- Combination with assets
    - What is the underlying assets accepted for the projects?
    - Does the asset has incompatibility with project (e.g., USDC has 6 decimal while normal ERC20 has 18) ?
- Collateral and Debt Records
    - Are the **Debt records correctly updated** during the process
- Fees/Interest caluculations
    - Is there any precision loss that could lead to loss?
    - Is the calculation model align with the design?
